## Description

<p>This is my first portfolio! So far we have completed the first two weeks of the bootcamp which focused on 
HTML and CSS elements. As I start my coding journey an important aspect is creating a place to showcase my work
and more importantly a place to highlight the strong skills I am honing in the form of functioning projects and the thought 
process behind them. The ultimate goal of this portfolio will be to show employers different high quality projects. 
Not only will the quality and difficulty of the projects increase as I continue my journey, but the format, styling and 
layout of my portfolio will also evolve as I do. <p>

// The Xpert Learning Assistant was consulted if i was confused with certain styles not applying properly.//
// I consulted the Xpert Learning Assistant when I was doing media queries. Mainly what the certain values meant
when it came to adjusting for a smaller screen.// 

// I watched this video to get a sense of website layout. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C_22eBWpjg&t=699s

// I looked up some portfolios on youtube for inspiration. The Challenge02 was assigned last thursday. My goal was, Ill give myself
Fri-Sat-Sun-Mon to make something different, and If its too hard, I will default to the mock up provided in the challenge
folder. I am not an artsy person and this project was out of my comfort zone. I came in with so many big ideas but was 
humbled very quickly. I realized I have to walk before I can run, but I can still try to push myself. 

The main inspiration I got from these website ideas was possible layout ideas and minimalist approaches. My journey
has just started but I am constantly practicing and trying new things. I also saw how they structured some html elements. 
The third video was a content creator who judged peoples portfolios and I used this video as inspiration again to see what different 
types of portfolio layouts and whats possible and not.

I also utilized the student mini project for week 2 to help with understadning flexbox properties and structuring the HTML
with that in mind.
